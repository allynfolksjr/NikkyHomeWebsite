        While attending the University of Washington in Seattle, I
        majored in <em>Law, Societies, and Justice</em>, a socio-legal
        discipline that instilled a strong sense of social justice and empathy
        into my ethos. Complementing the degree are minors in <em>Political
        Science</em> and <em>Human Rights</em>.

        I'm the co-owner of a small bundle of fur that occasionally
        bites us. We've named this fur <em>Minerva</em>. Her name is partially
        due to Minerva the goddess of strategy, partially due to the character
        from <em>Harry Potter</em>.

        I've lived in Seattle for the past <%= Time.now.year - 2006 %> years, and
        love being in the city that we often visited as a child. College
        gave me a love of public transit, and I strongly believe that cities
        can best meet the challenges of the 21st century through strong
        investments in walkability and transit.
