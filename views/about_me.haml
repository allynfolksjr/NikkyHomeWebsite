    %p I grew up in a small town in Puget Sound, and graduated from the University of Washington. When I'm not working with technology, I'm probably reading Science Fiction, watching Star Trek, or randomly perusing Wikipedia to soak up more interesting, but ultimately useless, information about the world around me. I've been known to <a href="http://nykida.net" target="_blank">blog</a> from time-to-time.
    %p Since High School, I've been exploring photography. While I currently shoot with a Canon DSLR, I'm never too far from my lovely Nikkormat FTn and using it to create super awesome film prints. My current photographic work can be found on my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/allynfolksjr">flickr</a>.
    %p Gaming is a part of my life, and I enjoy Real Time and Turn Based Strategy games on the computer. Civilization V, Dota2, Supreme Commander, Terraria, Homeworld, Starcraft, and Fallout3 are some of my favorites. When hanging out with friends, I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons, Settlers of Catan and Munchkin.
    %p Exploring new places is an important part of my life, and I've travelled all over the world to experience new cultures and see new sights. I've spent a month in Rome studying abroad, and I've also been to places such as Finland, Sweden, Iceland, England, and Ireland. Staying close to home is important too, and I've been throughout the United States, including diametrically opposed cities such as Kansas City and New York City. In the great Pacific Northwest, I hike around our various national parks and trails.
    %p I bake excellent cookies.
