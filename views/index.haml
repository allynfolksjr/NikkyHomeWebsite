        %p I'm a web developer and sysadmin based in Seattle who embraces open source technologies to create beautiful and elegant solutions with Ruby on Rails, Linux, and other technologies. I live in a technology-infused world, and seek to make it better by making things a little easier for everyone.
        %p If you would like to take a gander at what I'm coding, check out my <a href="http://github.com/allynfolksjr">github profile</a>. Perhaps photography is more your thing? I have a lovely <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/allynfolksjr">Flickr</a> filled to the brim. I've also been known to write about what I've been up to on my <a href="http://nykida.net">blog</a>.
