        %p I'm a full-stack web developer and systems administrator based in Seattle. I firmly believe in the of power open source software, and use OSS create beautiful and elegant solutions. My favorite tools are Ruby on Rails and a Linux stack, but I have experience with many other <a href="about-me">languages</a> and <a href="resume">technologies</a>. We live in a technology-infused world, and I seek to make it better by making things a little easier for everyone.
        %p If you would like to take a gander at what I'm coding, check out my <a href="http://github.com/allynfolksjr">github profile</a>. Perhaps photography is more your thing? I have a lovely <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/allynfolksjr">Flickr</a> filled to the brim. I've also been known to write about what I've been up to on my <a href="http://nykida.net">blog</a>.
